django-stream
=============

`|Build Status| <https://travis-ci.org/caffeinehit/django-stream>`_

django-stream provides activity streams for Django applications.

It differs from
`django-activity-stream <https://github.com/justquick/django-activity-stream>`_
in that it does not use generic relations and does not provide a
``Follow`` object, but it can be used together with
`django-follow <https://github.com/caffeinehit/django-follow>`_.

The motivation to not use generic relations is for simplicity reasons.
